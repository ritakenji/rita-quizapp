## üåêOverview

<!-- Write a brief summary explaining what the project is, its main purpose, and what someone can expect to find in the repository. -->
<p><a href="https://ritakenji.github.io/rita-quizapp/">Rita-quizapp</a> is the first (and second) on going project created as part of the Web-Development Front-End bootcamp's Recap Projects at Neuefische.</p>
<p>The task provided was simple: build the layout of a mobile web application, a quiz app. We were given the freedom to choose the theme of the quiz, or pick one of the options provided.</p>
<p>The main goal of this project was to apply all the learned and practiced subjects taught in the first week of the bootcamp: HTML and CSS. Part 2 of this project is to start implementing Javascript, to make the layout more interactable.</p>

### üìùNotes

This project will be edited as time goes by. Part 1 was creating the website's layout using only HTML and CSS. Part 2 will be implementing Javascript.

## üß©Features

The entirety of the website has incorporated resposive styling, meaning it can be viewed and interacted from any size of device (mobile, tablet, laptop or desktop).

It consists of 3 main pages:

- üè† **Home page**: Here, the user will have access to view all questions available on the platform.
  - Each card will have a question and upon clicking the button, the user unveils the correct answer.
  - For categorizing purposes, each card also contains a set of 3 tags related to the subject.
  - It is possible for the user to bookmark each question of their interest.
- üîñ **Bookmark page**: This is a dedicated space where the user can exclusively view the questions they've bookmarked, similar to the ones marked on the home page.
  - Here the user can not just view, but also remove a card from their saved bookmark selection.
- üë§ **Profile page**: This section allows the user to view and manage their profile and settings.
  - '_About Me_' section displays the user's bio.
  - Present on this page are 2 _counters_ - number of questions created and number of saved bookmarks.
  - Last section is '_Settings_', which allow user to toggle **Dark Mode** on and off.
